###### My departure from teaching math marks the official starting point of this journey.  However, it is a role that I have been preparing towards, for quite some time.  

My first exposure to the possibilities of statistical analysis when applied to technology was just about 2 years ago.  I created a tech start-up with my brother.  Our product measures the heavy metals of a consumer's drinking water.  Collects that data, compares it to existing measurements in the area and alerts the consumer of unsafe levels or even rising levels that can indicate the recent degradation of their water sources pipes.  

I built the device's hardware based upon my brother's idea. And as head of product development, it was my job to find someone who could solve the programming and data side of the problem.  We were participating in an IOT incubator at the time, it was a great experience where I learned a lot about start-ups and marketing myself, the largest obstacle was finding additional help when my entire day was already packed with meetings teaching me to be a businessman.    I needed a minimal viable product and working prototype before the first round of angel investor pitches in about a week.  I thought the data side would be simple, after all it is just collecting one number and comparing a few others.  

My search for help was where I found out what at data scientist does (I'm not sure I had even heard the term beforehand). When spending money I like to at least know what I am asking for so that I can gauge a person's competence.  Therefore, I attempted to solve the problem myself by programming an Arduino.  Well, I had no prior programming experience and after working all night I had something that did a thing, but not exactly the way in which I had envisioned.  So, I hired a programmer to make the app and help me broadcast the numbers I needed from our prototype.  He did this pretty well, so I gave him the task of using the data as we needed, and he took the task without asking questions.  After a few weeks, I needed something to show potential investors and he had absolutely nothing.  It became obvious he had no idea how to use the data in a way which was useful.  When I used simple math language to describe what we were looking for within the numbers his eyes would sort of just glaze over.  After much prodding he finally admitted to not understanding and suggested we hired a data scientist.

Since our funding was nearly depleted and we were almost on track for the second stage I worked out all the math using excel sheets to show the investors what the app should do once we hired a data scientist.  It turns out that most investors do not really care if a product is fully functional that early on and were entirely happy with not seeing my excel sheets.  Being a bit confused as to how so many people did not want to hear more about the really interesting component of product, I began to try to tell everyone. After all, I worked out how to tell if some deep and hidden pipe had an eroded seal exposing you and your loved ones to dangerous heavy metals, in real-time, using a gadget which costs $2 to make.  Realizing that this portion of the project was by far my favorite was when I began to day dream about doing it as a living.  Realizing that many people seemed bored or incapable of doing what I had been thoroughly enjoying doing was when I knew I could become a data scientist with a bit of training and time.
