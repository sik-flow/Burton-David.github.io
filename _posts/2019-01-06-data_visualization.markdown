Over the past two months I have started each day by visiting several websites for inspiration in my own projects.  By far, the most popular site of the bunch is Reddit's **r/dataisbeautiful.**

This has led me to the realization that a lot of people who make charts use the most impressive looking charts without caring if the format hinders understanding.  The purpose of this post is to help you avoid doing this.

**I'm also going to avoid offending people that might have made some of these graphs by letting the reader search on their own for relevant examples

I will, however, say that some of the most popular graphs fall into the category of  **trying to hard, and saying too little.**  For a more abundant plethora of non-examples we can head over to the other subreddit.  [r/dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/)

If you are looking at data to draw conclusions you have to have some idea as to what you are conveying.  Numbers for the sake of numbers is nothing at all.  Are you trying to convince a client to buy a certain commodity based upon past trends, showing that your startup is growing exponentially?  Understand that not everyone is going to look at the graph with the same perspective and assume nothing.    

A lifetime ago, as a film student, visual theory was my favorite area of study.  And, I am of the opinion that aspiring data scientists would do themselves a great service if they included a bit of visual theory into their studies.  

**A picture is worth a thousand words, make sure those words align with the numbers and intended message**

# Steps to creating the ideal visualization for your data
### Step 1: Revisit the question and message of your research
What question are you addressing.  Anything added to the graph that is not addressing the question is taking away from it.  So, stay on topic.

### Step 2: Choosing the right chart for your type of data
#### The following is a rough guide to put you on the right path

**comparing values

* Pie 
* Column
* Line
* Bar
* Bullet
* Scatter Plot
* Mekko

**distribution of data

* Line
* Column
* Scatter Plot
* Bar
* Mekko

**composition

* Pie
* Stacked Bar
* Mekko
* Stacked Column
* Area
* Waterfall

**trends

* Line
* Column

**relationship

* Bubble
* Line
* Scatter Plot

### Step 3: Label everything that needs labeled within the chart, the reader should not have to guess what they are looking at
We live in a world filled with fake news and propaganda.  This has created a culture of healthy skeptics.  Cite your sources, it doesn't need to be anything major.   A small note on the bottom is enough.  And be prepared to explain why you made the choices you made when analyzing the dataset

### Step 4: Make your message obvious within the chart.


**Put the data in the correct order and location to convey your intended message

**get rid of the junk

Anything that does not add to your message is taking away from the message.  

**emphasize the most relevant data with color, shape, size, position, enclosure, hue, and intensity

#### Step 4: Stop doing too much

### Hopefully this sets you on the right path when creating a data visualization.
This is, by far, an incomprehensive guide.  But, it is a place to start.  In conlcusion I would say that the most important take aways are to know you message, stay on topic, choose the right graph to display this message then once again make sure that there is no irrelevant information which will distract your audience.
